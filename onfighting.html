<b>On fighting </b>
Although, almost, I feign feeling (towards)
guilty gods (that) keep flagellating fillies,
(those) educated experts in finding flaws.
Poor products of fucked fathers,
Though I lack no foul feeling. So
Drawn dripping from free flowing
angry attitudes: I fight fright,
goad grudges and figure fleeing
erases everything. Forget future
dramatic dreams, I feel forgiven.
