<b>There was something magical seeing graves</b>
<b>lit up by explosions in the sky last night. </b>
<i>Tomb, stone, mark: crooked teeth.</i>

Fleeting bursts of starlight catch
above static explosions of green,
reports of their terrible passage ring.
Across peaks and shingles they ratch,
rustling leaves and rattling eves.

Glittering granite marks
for long dead loved-ones sparkle
with lost life once more.

Spent gunpowder seeds a warm breeze.
Which dissolves entrails in a haze,
smearing eviscera across a staccato sky.

We are not the only ones awake tonight,
for while those that grieve lay in shallow slumber,
we dead friends dance on our empty graves,
our hollow footsteps ring loud
on the trussed and vaulted earth.
