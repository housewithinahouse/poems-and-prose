<b>Endless Summer</b>
I wish for endless magic summer, world of green and gold, sunlight filtered through leaves spilling down shafts of light and pooling at the base of every elm and oak tree. I want to crawl into pine bough defined fortresses, surrounded by crisp green needles, a hollow with a bed of yesteryear's leaves. I would curl up there with you, alone in our secret house, branches for it's roof, until the summer storm blows in, drives us running towards less permeable shelter. Under the eaves of a house we'll sit, cool drops of rain splattering the concrete at our toes, a splashing, dripping, misty mess.

Shivering with the sudden drop in temperature, and our pervasive damp state, we'll huddle as the cloudburst passes, emerging to a sun which breaks up the sky. Sweet blue infinity stretches from either end of the horizon, and it too deep to fathom. The still dew-sweet grass will keep us cool, as we bake dry in the sun. Only to find ourselves too hot once more, in the moments we hang over the edge of a blue-green pit, suspended for golden moments in a fit of energy, before gravity finds its mark and drags us crashing through the once-still surface of that lake, our splashes begat waves begat ripples.

A walk would lead us into a field of perfect stones, each one turned flat and round from the procession of water dragging dirt across its surface for generations. Worn smooth for the singular moment of flight it experiences, rebounding in parabolic arcs, skipping across the waves.
