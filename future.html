&#171; Periodically, the trail was interrupted by the bloodless remains of fallen trunks. Most laid draped with a blanket woven from eons of moss and fungal growth, feeding off their home's rotting interior. When trod upon, those that had been so digested quickly yielded, disintegrating instantly into pulpy fragments, splintering under heel. Others hadn't progressed this far yet, granting passage with only a creak in reply. Most had never seen the tread of a boot in in their countless days, and were still yet intact.  However, among the oldest and largest of the fallen, the path had worn right through them; some number of ancient travelers ground the once mighty trunk into sawdust and soil underfoot. With these, the log was bifurcated, bisected by the trail, both halves of the trunk became the walls of a short, narrow canyon.

Where these collapsed trees once stood, remained only shallow depressions from where their roots had been torn bodily out of the ground as they fell, pits bounded on one side by the gnarled undersurface of the fallen. As the upended roots made their skyward passage, they disturbed the soil around it, tearing the rich, dark humus away and exposing and striating the subsoil. In time, the pits that have lain fallow are now a caldron of decaying plant matter, slowly being digested by the worms and their ilk.

At even longer intervals, the logs left lying here have learned the secrets of soil, informed by their microbial mates, and buried in the discarded droppings of those-who-remain-standing, transforming them into miniature mounds. The forest floor thus forms a recreation of the surrounding topography in miniature: pits and mounds to hills and hollows.
A fractalized landscape. &#187;
