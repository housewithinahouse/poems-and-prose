<b>Verge</b>
What a mighty staff that is,
to take measure of your authority.
Do you make them swear upon it,
pledge their fealty?

Jutting out, projecting forth.
A margin, your edges.

Ticking away in the night,
keeps the passing hours in check.
A boundary or a border.

Or is that just your dick,
you spineless fuck?
