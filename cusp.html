<b>Cusp</b>
<i>For Merriam and Webster. </i>

A point of transition,
a changing of ways,
either horn of the crescent moon.

The point at which a curve bends back.
Projections, pointed, formed from overlapping arcs,
lobes and scalloped forms.

Any point on the grinding surface of a tooth,
and, that fold in your heart.
