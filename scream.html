<b>I want to scream from a rooftop, I want it to be over. </b>
To the endless outpouring of emotionally-stunted empty words,
Please, for once, dont ring so hollow.

There's time later for worrying what they'd say,
Wondering about that pregnant pause that never seems to deliver.

Is it better to labor over my lines until they feel forced,
Out from loose lips and into shuttered ears?

No one cares about this marginally related thing,
Trivial thoughts that die on wing.

A connection so tenuous that before it crosses the threshold of my lips,
It's already dissolved into sinewy strands that stick in my teeth.

My mouth bears witness to the mute tension so palpable tonight.
I hope the right thing manages to escape my trap.
