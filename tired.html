<b>This shouldn't come as a surprise, I'm tired. </b>
Swollen days weigh down time like a wet sweater.
Control is what you make of it,
and I've got a feeling that it's going to be good.

There are taste buds in your pancreas,
and your stomach has a brain.
Savor these long forgotten flavors.

You call home like you call a dog.
Tremendous temperate rainforests line my intestinal walls.
Vast, thinking nets catch butterflies at blood's blush.
Aspartame-tinged plasma deceives my pancreas, causes it to fall in love.
Digestion begins in the mouth, a wet, saliva soaked sound.

There are things I want, that I do not have.
The cold still of night, you're tucked in tight,
wrapped up next to me.
Be happy for these moments,
shared between warm bodies on cool evenings,
I know they don't last forever.
I lost all the points that made up that constellation.
What will I look like when I get old?
