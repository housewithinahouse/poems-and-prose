<h3>Lessness</h3>
We've got nowhere to do,
No home to crawl into
No bed to sleep under,
Our roof's been torn asunder.

Our floors do not keep the drafts out,
And the walls make for a terrible shame:
(I can hear them calling)
"Walk on, walk on", through the rain.

Those same figures still haunt these streets,
Though their faces may change,
Their cry remains the same:
<div style="padding-left:1em;"><i>"If this happens to me, it could happen to you,
where would you go and what would you do?</i></div>
I just need some rest, some time to myself,
My limbs grow heavy, I'm in terrible health.
I won't stay long, won't trouble you much,
I just can't go on any longer."
