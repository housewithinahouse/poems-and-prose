<b>Winsome</b>

Slow black trails a windowsill, a multifidus marching line
slow slipping home in moist poison, to roost in my chest,
down multi-branching mega highways alongside my spine
I sit and stumble, a confused shambling shuffle to rest,
as it courses those forks without a single tine.

Various visions threaten at the corners of existence,
killing coordination through some series of calculated steps
designed for the provocation of flight. Frightful resistance
to our plans, I know I can.
