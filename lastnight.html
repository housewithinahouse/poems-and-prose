<b>Where was I last night? </b>
<i>How did I get home? When did I stop remembering?
Did I make a fool out of my self?</i>

Awaking in a strange bed, the one that I own. Still dressed, never/ever ready for what last night held. Sour litmus test acid wash green flavored remnants left floating in my mouth, scraps of words I spoke, possible amber tinted time left developing too long bleached out prints. Slow time and thoughts drug out of molasses morass fog clouds liver and kidneys choke down spirits cashed with stupidity, morning maps missing continents and forced to be content with that. Sober seconds before bitter names ring and circle and flit and dive and crawl out from every other pore, between alternating teeth.
I woke early and wondered where I was.
