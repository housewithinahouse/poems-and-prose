<b>My open mouth gropes wetly with an ugly vowel</b>

A sound, turned round, found bound
up in my books, emits a cry like it looks,
rubber rings and soft things in dreams.

It catches sometimes,
these odd sounds of mine,
in the back of a throat, or

Teeth and tongue click,
slop slick and pick, with some intensity,
at concatenated consonants
flung forth with their particular propensity.

But at once, my train escapes,
lose and long, buckling like a belt,
an unbroken line soon shattered and spent,
left sputtering sadly on spiral sidings

Words slip and stick, fast in tarry pits,
and slow in light of pitch colored thoughts
that make me itch, soon soothed
by a calamine coinage, guaranteed relief
for pruritic phantom phonemes,
my lost phrases, those forgotten spells.
