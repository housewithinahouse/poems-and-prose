<b>Thoughts From Today</b>

They are working on the building outside today,
The circular saw says "the concrete splinters",
as it draws empty lines though artificial stone.
Chunks of the non-sedimentary sort,
hard surfaces, pried whole from the earth.

There's something sad, that I can't quite put into words,
about grinding up millions of years of pressure and heat,
destroying endless layers, put down millimeters at a time,
to be pulverised, mixed up and spread in hard layer that smothers
the earth for a time. In the end though, our rocks are not
as strong as those from from the painstaking accumulation
of compacted soil and dust. Soon they all rot away, our
works fade so much faster these day then they used to.

I don't mind the buildings that crumble, I hope they all melt,
someday, I think, I might have green hair. Or lavender locks
in my eyes and my mouth. A raspberry ringlet cascade.
The kids today all look like maids, in frilly frocks and skirts.
It's a costume, to be sure, do you think that the Diamond Age
will come true? Neo-victorians with a new morality: deferring
demurely any semblance of impropriety. (Though once, from
behind a locked and shuttered door, I thought I heard a curse
cried out)

David Bowie released a new album this year, The Next Day,
I've not heard it, and I've only seen it once, and I don't really care.
But I love him in the Labyrinth, or at least his prominent penis,
like many when they were little did. I think that may have been
when you were first aroused. I know I might have been.
Even so, don't worry young men, silver lips betray,
rainbowed hearts grow heavy, and that thing inside you dies.

"The human body does not handle excessive blood loss well,"
understates google, when I Ask it what platelets are, because I
had confused them with palate (which I had called pallet) above.
Although, I should have lingered on pallets a little longer,
symptomatic supplies of global chain, utilitarian and toxic.

The tender science of standards, international or otherwise,
brings my heart such great joy. Concrete blocks, I-beams,
"dimensional lumber"; coded, every inch of them fully understood.
Something: about how they all are unerringly regular, cogs in a
global articulated architecture, prefabricated buildings built for
self-similar economies of any scale, the hollowed halls of a
monster. Is my future really worth less the older I get? Damn.
