<b>It's a pitiful sort of struggle, I find myself locked into:</b>
<i>listlessness and melancholy
hopelessness and silly follies.</i>

I'd like to think that I'm possessed by foresight,
(at least when I lie awake into the night)
but I know that i utterly lack follow-through, through & through.

I've spent too many mornings hugging my knees to my chest,
Not getting out of bed after a long night of nothing.
Lying awake, listening to the creaks and pops
Of my house and housemates,
Stumbling home,
Drunk and stupid.

A miamsia forms under my sheets
And in my throat. I want to curl up,
Go back to sleep, for a while.

What sticky black substance am I full of this week?
Pine tar or coffee, grease or tea.
My life feels full of wasted days,
I spend an eternity exploring the contours of my bed.

I have dreams and desires and wants and plans,
but they all seem to fall apart.
