<b>A lightness in the air, a spring in my step. </b>
Sun shining, night falls
On antipodal points at orthogonal times.
Here I am, with heavens spinning overhead,
Ground tilting beneath feet. I am a dervish,
And the world pirouettes around me.

Slow, steady progression of titanic plates
Across, under, and besides the one I call home
Causes fractures and splits in it's surface.
The very ground I stand on has been subsumed,
And is consuming others.
Nothing remains untouched by this procession.
