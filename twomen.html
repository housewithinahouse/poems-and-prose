<b>Two men sit on a bench, in front of the elevators.</b>
&#171; One of them, the one I can't see from my vantage, writes. They are discussing one of their books, something they have written, or are in the process of writing. The one who I can see is a editor, or a friend who thinks they are. He asks the writer to defend his characters, his choice of plot, asking if entire characters could disappear from the fabric of the writers story, asking what would that change?
They face forward, the writer and the editor, the former speaks in soft tones, and I make up most of his part, but the editor projects clear across to me, and I carry on my own conversation with him. He asks if I could foreground the problem, and wonders why I don't know what he is talking about. He regales me with stories about his stint in IUs writing program, though I miss half of what he says because of the large libro-industrial sorting machine ca-chucking away in the background, I wish he would repeat himself. He agrees, I think, that this isn't the most conducive way to have a conversation.
Now we talk grammer. Use paragraphs he tells me, like this is some revelation or even useful advice. <i>"Like this?"</i> I ask him as I write. Is it nice when my paragraphs contain too few or far too many lines?
Even so, I wish that I could find feedback that actually causes me to have to think critically about what I've done. I need to find workshops, or writing groups, or mean people to back into a corner and read aloud to. Interesting. That's the worst thing that you can hear, or say about a work. It's like describing something as ok. or nice. A value judgement, but one without consequence, it doesn't really pin anything down about anything. It's like drawing a circle for a head. Sure, it points to something, but sheds no light on it's qualities. &#187;
