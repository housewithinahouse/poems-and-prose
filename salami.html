<b>I ate all the salami last night</b>
Skin sticks in teeth, tough
casings caught between my bicuspids
Corns crack under masticating molars,
bursting bright pain onto palate.
Soon soothed, as fatty flecks,
sweet succulent globules of goodness,
roll, ringing in high hallelujah!
Bite after bite, ripping riotously
through thick salami shards,
gladly going down greedy gullet.
Thick things, dripping with desire.

<i>But:</i>
Salt sticks in atrophied arteries,
dying from disuse, or mearly misuse.
Packing peat, my molasses mass.
Golden germination in soiled cells,
fat fucks my cellular serenity.

(it kills just the same.)
God, I must be hungry,
or I've eaten too much already.
